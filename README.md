## Overview

LFX Tools have become an essential part of the open-source project tool kit. To that end, the mission of the CDF LFX Requirements Working Group is to gather input from the CDF open-source projects on issues and future enhancements to the LFX Tools platform. In addition, the Working Group will share the results of their requirements gathering with the CDF TOC. The CDF TOC will review the Working Group requirements and submit feedback to the LFX Tools teams for consideration.
